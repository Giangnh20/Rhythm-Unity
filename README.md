See other branches for more recent changes.

Default Scene is Map selector

Current Progress: 
* Auto Play (no manual play yet)
* Android support
* Partial slider implemented
* Map play speed adjustment (only through code atm, play speed is dynamicly tied to audio playback speed)


Feature Goals:

* Ability to import maps from OSU
* Slow or speed up maps for fine difficulty adjustment
* Advance UI modding
* Feature full API
and more yet to be listed...

Excuse the non clean code. theres a lot of trial and error in this project and clean code is not number 1 priority atm as it will most likely be rewritten :/
