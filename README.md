# Music-Game
OSU Clone made in Unity

There are tests maps bundled with this project using LFS. make sure you pull from LFS also!

Only auto play works atm.

Sliders currently do not work correctly. disable show sliders or whatever its called in  tap tap setup file if you want to see auto play hit every circle.

Feature Goals:

* Ability to import maps from OSU
* Slow or speed up maps for fine difficulty adjustment
* Advance UI modding
* Feature full API
and more yet to be listed...
