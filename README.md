There are tests maps bundled with this project using LFS. make sure you pull from LFS also!


See other branches for more recent changes.

Only auto play works atm.

Feature Goals:

* Ability to import maps from OSU
* Slow or speed up maps for fine difficulty adjustment
* Advance UI modding
* Feature full API
and more yet to be listed...

If you're interested in taking part of this project, feel free to email me :)

Excuse the non clean code. theres a lot of trial and error in this project and clean code is not number 1 priority atm as it will most likely be rewritten :/
