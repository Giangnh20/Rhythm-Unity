# Rhythm-Unity
OSU Clone made in Unity

There are tests maps bundled with this project, click the download maps button on the map selector screen to download them.

See other branches for more recent changes.

Default Scene is `Map Select`

Current Progress: 
* Auto Play (no manual play yet, but can easily be done by handling input as auto play is written to "emulate user input")
* Android support
* Partial slider types implemented
* Slider dynamic back and fourth travel
* Play speed mod (Play speed is dynamic and tied to audio playback speed, use the slider on map selection menu to change this)


Feature Goals:

* Ability to import maps from OSU
* Slow or speed up maps for fine difficulty adjustment
* Advance UI modding
* Feature full API

Excuse the non clean code. theres a lot of trial and error in this project and clean code is not number 1 priority atm as it will most likely be rewritten :/
